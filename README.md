# modmover
a simple mod manager for Minecraft mods


This is just a tool to help me manage my Minecraft mods better. I used to just make the directories manually and copy the mods to and from it. 
But that gets confusing sometimes, and this way it is easier and more manageable for me and especially for people who are less experienced with moving around mods.

have fun using it! (or have more ease?)

anyway, meow meow
